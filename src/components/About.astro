        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a passionate developer with expertise in building modern web applications. I love turning ideas into reality through clean, 
            efficient code and thoughtful design.
        </p>
        <p>
            With experience in both frontend and backend development, I enjoy the full spectrum of web development.
            I'm always eager to learn new technologies and best practices to stay at the forefront of the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy writing technical blog posts, and
            staying active in the developer community.
